An easy-to-use interface into the wurl social plugins.

== Description ==

The Wordpress plugin allows you to easily add Wurl SDK widgets to 
your Wordpress installation.

For more information on the Wurl SDK widgets, visit
[Wurl SDK](http://wrl.it/sdkdocs/widgets/feed/ "the plugin SDK 
documentation").

== Installation ==

To install the plugin:

e.g.

1. Upload `wurl.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Visit the Widgets URL

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What Javascript is added to this? =

An answer to that question.

= Widgets are not showing up! =

If you added the widget and it is not displaying, it's because some
themes don't have a wp_footer function called. Go to the very bottom
of your theme, before the </body> close tag, and add:

`<? wp_footer() ?>`
`</body>`

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable
readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets 
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would
win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
